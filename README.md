# memory-handling-solidity
A project for the comprehension of solidity (>=0.7.0 <0.9.0) memory handling (memory &amp; storage).

## Description
I am really new with solidity (I writing this with only two weeks of study), so don't trust completelly in the explanations in the comments. I was trying to understand how work the memory management of solidity, and I started to make some funny experiments and form there I pulled out some deductions of how this work. So I am really open to discuss about the experiments and the corresponding deductions that I made :)

## What is in the experiments?
If you are struggling in of how the memory on solidity work or what are the differences between storage memory and local memory in solidity this experiments may clear your mind.

There are 6 experiments that consist in predict the value that will hold the variable `hold` after the execution of some functions which playing with memory objects and storage object references will modify or not the value of `hold`.

## How to run
There is only a contract called Memory which you can run successfully in [Remix](remix.ethereum.org) using Compiler v0.8.10 which is the latest at the time I wrote this.
